# NTSDCN: New Three-Stage Deep Convolutional Image Demosaicking Network 

Implementation of "NTSDCN: New Three-Stage Deep Convolutional Image Demosaicking Network " 

TCSVT



## Installation
The code was developed using Python 3.5 & TensorFlow 1.9.0 & CUDA 9.0. 

## Code v1.0
Currently, we release our research code for testing. The algorithm was reimplemented by us and got better results than the paper.
